# Janusz Nowakowski

**Cloud & Infrastructure Lead | Senior SRE | Bitcoin Infrastructure Enthusiast**

I’m an engineer with 30 years in IT. I build large-scale, cloud-native platforms and lead SRE and DevOps teams across regulated and high-performance environments.  
My focus is automation, reliability, and simplicity.

I’ve led teams and delivered solutions for companies like **Roche, Hilti, Sygnum Bank, Google,** and **BIS** — designing secure, scalable systems on **AWS, Azure, and Kubernetes**.

Beyond cloud work, I’m a [Bitcoiner](https://cloudindustry.ch/bitcoin/) and active in the **Bitcoin and Lightning** ecosystem.  
I write and interview at [Lightning.News](https://lightning.news/author/janusz/) — a publication that connects Bitcoin builders with the business world.
